# Power of 2 Project
## Code to check if a number is a power of 2

I developed this code as a college exercise (August 19, 2025), with the purpose of showing:
X number is a power of 2. Exponent: Y (if the number is indeed a power of 2).

Not a power of 2 (if it is not a power of 2).

Exercise to practice the fundamentals of Programming Logic in C, such as:

1) Repetition Structures (while loop)
2) Decision Structures (if/else)
3) Error Handling (Input Validation)
4) Flow Control (break and continue)
5) Mathematical Functions and Libraries
6) Working with Data Types
7) Problem-Solving Algorithm (logical sequence of steps)
